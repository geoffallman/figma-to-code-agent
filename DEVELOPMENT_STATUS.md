## üìÖ Session History (Reverse Chronological)

### üìÜ 2025-10-24 (Evening): Designer Triage System + Hub & Spoke Documentation

**Time:** ~6 hours (afternoon/evening session)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Major infrastructure built!

**What We Built:**

1. **Designer Triage System** (2 hours)
   - `tools/triage_issues.py` - Issue categorization + question generator
   - `scripts/run_multi_iteration_with_triage.py` - Multi-iteration loop with plateau detection
   - Runs 2 automatic improvement iterations
   - Triages ALL remaining issues after 2 loops
   - Generates specific designer questions with context & recommendations

2. **Hub & Spoke Documentation Pattern** (1 hour)
   - Created `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as single source of truth
   - Organized all docs into `docs/sessions/`, `docs/analysis/`, `docs/proposals/`
   - Tidied repo root (only 2 .md files allowed!)
   - Created `STATUS-LINK.md` in Claudesidian
   - Documented pattern in `project-documentation-pattern.md`

3. **Image Copy Bug Fix** (30 min)
   - Fixed images not loading in improvement loop iterations
   - Images now propagate across iterations automatically
   - Updated `run_improvement_loop_with_measurements.py`

4. **Updated /project-checkpoint Command** (30 min)
   - Aligned with Hub & Spoke pattern
   - Updates PROJECT_STATUS.md (not README.md)
   - Creates session summaries in `docs/sessions/`
   - Documented in `project-checkpoint-update-summary.md`

**Key Breakthrough - User Insight:**
> "Some remaining issues could benefit from the designer adding context about their intent or offering a compromise based on the realities of HTML."

This led to building the triage system - recognizing that not all Figma dimensions should be matched exactly, and complex design decisions need human judgment.

**Files Created:**
- `tools/triage_issues.py` (340 lines)
- `scripts/run_multi_iteration_with_triage.py` (380 lines)
- `docs/analysis/TRIAGE_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` - Complete documentation
- `docs/analysis/IMAGE_COPY_BUG_FIX.md` - Bug fix documentation
- `docs/sessions/DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/sessions/ROOT_TIDYING_SUMMARY.md`
- `06_Metadata/Reference/project-documentation-pattern.md`
- `06_Metadata/Reference/project-checkpoint-update-summary.md`

**Next:** Build designer response parser + continuation workflow to complete the triage loop

---

### üìÜ 2025-10-24 (Morning): DOM Measurement Tool + Improvement Loop

**Time:** 4 hours
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Phase 1 successful!

**What We Built:**
1. **DOM Measurement Tool** (2.5 hours)
   - `tools/measure_dom_simple.js` - Playwright-based dimension extraction
   - `tools/compare_measurements.py` - Comparison + feedback generation
   - `scripts/evaluate_with_measurements.py` - Integrated evaluation

2. **Improvement Loop Integration** (1.5 hours)
   - `scripts/run_improvement_loop_with_measurements.py` - Complete iteration

**Test Results:**
- **Iteration 1:** 66% ‚Üí 76% (+10% improvement, 5/11 issues fixed) ‚úÖ
- **Iteration 2:** 76% ‚Üí 76% (plateau - 0 additional fixes) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ DOM measurements >> Vision LLM for dimensional accuracy
- ‚úÖ Specific feedback ("480px ‚Üí 576px") drives measurable improvement
- ‚úÖ Simple fixes (width, font-size) work great (71% success rate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex fixes (line-height, containers) need better tooling

**Files Created:**
- `DOM_MEASUREMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details
- `DOM_MEASUREMENT_RESULTS.md` - Analysis of 2 iterations
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete session overview
- Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` with Phase 1 results

**Next:** Improve element selectors & compound fixes to break 76% plateau

---

### üìÜ 2025-10-23: Vision LLM + Code Improvement Agent

**Days:** 6-7 (Week 2)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**What We Built:**
- Day 6: Vision evaluation with Claude Haiku 3.5
- Day 7: Code improvement with Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Hybrid model strategy (Haiku for eval, Sonnet for code)

**Key Achievement:** Full iteration loop working end-to-end

**Issues Discovered:**
- Vision LLM variability: 92.5% ‚Üí 65% on same image
- Need for objective measurements (led to today's DOM tool!)

**Files:** `docs/day6-vision-evaluation.md`, `docs/day7-code-improvement.md`

---

### üìÜ 2025-10-14: Week 1 - Core Infrastructure

**Days:** 1-5
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (100%)

**What We Built:**
- Day 1: Environment setup + MCP investigation
- Day 2: Baseline code generation (Figma MCP)
- Day 3: Rendering with Playwright
- Day 4: Pixel-diff comparison (pixelmatch)
- Day 5: End-to-end baseline validation

**Key Achievement:** All core tools validated and operational

**Files:** `docs/day1-findings.md`, various test scripts

---

### üìÜ 2025-10-08 (Pre-project): Spike Phase

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Validated feasibility

**What We Learned:**
- Figma MCP can generate code
- Pixel-diff provides objective scores
- Multi-agent pattern (builder + evaluator) viable
- 85%+ accuracy achievable with iteration

**Files:** `Claudesidian/01_Projects/Figma-to-Code Agent/spike/`

---

## üéì Key Learnings (Consolidated)

### ‚úÖ What Works Exceptionally Well

1. **DOM Measurements for Dimensions**
   - Objective (always same result)
   - Specific (exact pixel values)
   - Actionable (clear fixes)
   - **71% success rate on medium-priority issues**

2. **Hybrid Model Strategy**
   - Haiku 3.5 for evaluation (~$0.001/run)
   - Sonnet 4.5 for code improvement (~$0.01/run)
   - Total: ~$0.011/iteration

3. **Figma REST API**
   - 100% reliable (vs MCP connection issues)
   - Image extraction works perfectly
   - All metadata available

4. **Pixel-diff Primary Metric**
   - Stable, objective baseline
   - Vision LLM too variable for primary metric
   - Best used together: Pixel-diff (70%) + Vision LLM (30%)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Improvement

1. **Vision LLM Unreliability**
   - Same image: 0%, 100%, 98%, 92.5%, 65% across runs
   - Says "pixel-perfect" when 33% of pixels differ
   - Good for semantics, poor for measurements

2. **Complex Dimensional Issues**
   - Line-height vs height confusion
   - Container vs content height
   - Compound fixes (multiple CSS properties)
   - **0% success rate on high-priority complex issues**

3. **Element Selector Accuracy**
   - Generic selectors (h1, img:first) insufficient
   - Need IDs or data attributes
   - Measuring wrong elements sometimes

4. **Missing Component Context**
   - "Add container element" too vague
   - Need structural templates
   - Requires full component specs

### üí° Insights for Future Improvements

- **Add IDs during code generation** ‚Üí 100% accurate element matching
- **Provide compound fixes** ‚Üí "Set height=24px AND line-height=24px"
- **Component templates** ‚Üí Structured specs for missing UI elements
- **Measure containers + content** ‚Üí Track both wrapper and inner elements
- **Multi-pass refinement** ‚Üí 3-5 iterations with escalating specificity

## üìä Decision Log (Why We Made Key Choices)

### ‚úÖ Why DOM Measurements Over Vision LLM Only?

**Problem:** Vision LLM said "pixel-perfect" when 33% of pixels differed

**Decision:** Build DOM measurement tool for objective dimensional feedback

**Result:** +10% improvement in one iteration, validated approach

**Date:** October 24, 2025

---

### ‚úÖ Why Figma REST API Instead of MCP?

**Problem:** MCP connection unreliable (showed "Connected" but tools didn't expose)

**Decision:** Switch to Figma REST API (Day 8)

**Result:** 100% reliability, all features available

**Date:** October 14-24, 2025

---

### ‚úÖ Why Hybrid Model Strategy (Haiku + Sonnet)?

**Problem:** Sonnet for everything = $0.04/iteration

**Decision:** Haiku ($0.001) for eval, Sonnet ($0.01) for code = $0.011/iteration

**Result:** 73% cost reduction, same quality

**Date:** October 23, 2025

---

### ‚úÖ Why Pixel-diff 70% + Vision LLM 30%?

**Problem:** Vision LLM too variable to be primary metric

**Decision:** Use pixel-diff as stable baseline, Vision LLM for semantics

**Result:** Combined score more reliable than either alone

**Date:** October 23, 2025
