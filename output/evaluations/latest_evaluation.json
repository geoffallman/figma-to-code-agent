I'll analyze the visual fidelity between these two images.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"semantic_score\": 98.0,\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"Near-perfect visual match between Figma design and rendered output\",\n  \"feedback\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"layout\",\n      \"issue\": \"Close (X) button missing from top-right of menu\",\n      \"measurement\": \"Top-right quadrant empty\",\n      \"fix\": \"Add absolute positioned close/X button at top-right\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"strengths\": [\n    \"Exact menu section typography\",\n    \"Correct menu category ordering\",\n    \"Perfect color palette preservation\",\n    \"Consistent spacing between menu sections\",\n    \"Accurate status bar representation\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe images are essentially identical. The only notable omission is the close (X) button in the top-right corner, which appears to be missing from the rendered HTML/CSS output. Everything else - font styling, section spacing, color scheme, and overall layout - matches the original design with remarkable precision.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the visual comparison?"
