# Designer Triage System - Complete! ✅

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** ✅ Built and tested
**Purpose:** Enable human-in-the-loop for complex design decisions after automatic improvements plateau

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

**User Insight:**
> "Some remaining issues could benefit from the designer adding context about their intent or offering a compromise based on the realities of HTML. How do we handle more complex elements like the floating UI bar?"

**The Impedance Mismatch:**
- Figma = absolute positioning, fixed dimensions, design-time snapshot
- HTML = flow-based layout, content-driven sizing, runtime flexibility
- **Not all Figma dimensions should be matched exactly!**

**Key Realization:**
Some issues need:
1. Designer intent clarification
2. HTML reality acknowledgment
3. Compromise/approval from designer

---

## ✅ What We Built

### 1. Issue Triage System (`tools/triage_issues.py`)

**Categorizes issues into:**
- **Auto-fixable:** Simple dimensional fixes (widths, fonts)
- **Needs designer input:** Complex structural decisions, trade-offs

**Smart categorization logic:**
- Detects issues stuck across multiple iterations
- Recognizes patterns (missing elements, height mismatches)
- Prioritizes by complexity and impact

### 2. Designer Question Generator

**Generates specific questions with:**
- **Context:** What the issue is, what we tried
- **Question:** Clear, specific ask
- **Options:** Multiple choice answers
- **Recommendation:** What we think is best

**Question Types:**

**A) Missing Complex Components:**
```
Element: floating-selection-bar

Context: Complex UI component exists in Figma but structure
unclear from dimensions alone.

Question: What should be inside 'floating-selection-bar'?
How should it be structured in HTML?

Options:
[DESCRIBE] Describe the structure
[OPTIONAL] It's optional - can be omitted
[DEFER] Add in next iteration

Recommendation: Describe structure for best fidelity
```

**B) Fixed vs Flexible Height:**
```
Element: left column

Context: Figma shows fixed height (224px), but HTML naturally
sizes to 24px based on content.

Question: Should 'left column' be fixed height or flexible?

Options:
[FIXED] Fixed at 224px (may crop content)
[FLEXIBLE] Flexible (auto) - web best practice
[MIN-HEIGHT] Minimum 224px, can grow if needed

Recommendation: Flexible (auto) for web-native behavior
```

**C) Typography Trade-offs:**
```
Element: Product title

Context: Text height includes font-size + line-height.
Figma uses exact heights, HTML needs readable line-height.

Question: For 'Product title', what matters more?

Options:
[FONT-SIZE] Font-size accuracy (allow natural line-height)
[TOTAL-HEIGHT] Total height accuracy (may look cramped)
[BALANCED] Balanced approach (1.2-1.3 line-height)

Recommendation: Font-size accuracy with natural line-height
```

### 3. Multi-Iteration Loop with Designer Triage

**Workflow:**
```
Loop 1: Auto-fix easy issues
  ↓
Loop 2: Validate & attempt remaining
  ↓
After 2 loops, IF any issues remain:
  ↓
TRIAGE: Generate designer questions
  (regardless of whether we improved!)
  ↓
PAUSE: Wait for designer input
```

**Smart logic:**
- **Always runs 2 automatic iterations**
- **Always triages remaining issues** (after 2 loops)
- Tracks plateau as diagnostic info (did we improve?)
- Designer sees ALL remaining issues, not just stuck ones

### 4. Designer Question Output

**Two formats generated:**

**A) JSON** (`designer_questions.json`):
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "iterations_attempted": 2,
    "total_issues": 6,
    "auto_fixable": 2,
    "needs_designer_input": 4,
    "plateau_detected": true
  },
  "designer_questions": [
    {
      "element": "floating-selection-bar",
      "figma_id": "157:817",
      "question": "What should be inside...",
      "options": [...],
      "recommendation": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**B) Formatted Text** (`designer_questions.txt`):
```
🔍 ISSUE TRIAGE REPORT

After 2 automatic improvement iterations:
  • Total issues: 6
  • Auto-fixable: 2 ✅
  • Needs designer input: 4 ❓

## 📊 How It Works

### The Flow:

```
Start: HTML with 11 issues (66% accuracy)
  ↓
Iteration 1: Auto-fix easy stuff
  ↓ (widths, fonts, simple dimensions)
Result: 6 issues remaining (76% accuracy) - 5 fixed! ✅
  ↓
Iteration 2: Attempt remaining issues
  ↓ (try harder on complex ones)
Result: 6 issues remaining (76% accuracy) - 0 fixed ⚠️
  ↓
PLATEAU DETECTED (no improvement)
  ↓
TRIAGE: Categorize issues
  ↓
  ├─ 2 auto-fixable (will retry with designer context)
  └─ 4 need designer input
     ↓
     Generate Questions
       ├─ Missing component (1)
       ├─ Fixed vs flexible (2)
       └─ Typography trade-offs (1)
     ↓
PAUSE: Save questions, wait for designer
  ↓
Designer Reviews Questions
  ↓ (provides answers in designer_responses.json)
Designer Provides Input
  ↓
Iteration 3+: Apply designer guidance
  ↓
Complete! ✅
```

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### Why 2 Loops Before Triage?

**1 Loop (Too Early):**
- Questions include auto-fixable stuff
- Designer sees noise
- "Why are you asking about width?!"

**2 Loops (Just Right):**
- Auto-fixable issues are filtered out
- Questions are specific, validated
- Designer sees only what needs their input
- Context: "We tried X, Y failed"

**3+ Loops (Too Late):**
- Wasted compute
- No new information
- Diminishing returns

**Decision: MAX_AUTO_ITERATIONS = 2** ✅

### Why Always Triage After 2 Loops (Not Just on Plateau)?

**Original logic (Wrong):**
```
IF plateau detected (no improvement):
  → Ask designer
ELSE:
  → Keep going automatically
```

**Problem:** Misses cases where we improved but remaining issues still need context!

**Better logic (Correct):**
```
After 2 loops, IF any issues remain:
  → ALWAYS ask designer
  → Even if we made progress!
```

**Why this is better:**

1. **We committed to "2 loops before designer"** - not "plateau detection"
2. **Even with improvement, remaining issues might need context**
   - Example: 66% → 71% is good, but 7 remaining issues might still need designer input
3. **Issues might be interconnected**
   - Fixing one might depend on designer approval of another
   - Designer might say "actually, those 3 are related, here's the real structure"
4. **Designer might approve current state**
   - "These 6 issues? They're fine, ship it!"
   - Or: "Focus on issues 1-3, ignore 4-6"

**Plateau becomes diagnostic info:**
- ⚠️ "Plateau detected" = No improvement, definitely stuck
- ✅ "Progress made" = Improved, but still want your input

**Result:** Designer always sees remaining issues after 2 loops, with full context about whether we're stuck or just want guidance.

### Why Categorization?

**Not all issues are created equal:**

**Auto-fixable:**
- Widths (560px → 500px)
- Font sizes (30px → 24px)
- Simple dimensions

**Needs Designer:**
- Missing complex components
- Structural decisions (fixed vs flex)
- Trade-offs (readability vs pixel-perfect)

**Benefit:** Designer only sees what needs their expertise

### Why Multiple Choice Options?

**Better than free-form:**
- Faster for designer (click vs type)
- Structured responses (easier to parse)
- Shows we understand trade-offs
- Includes recommendations (guides decision)

**Still flexible:**
- Always includes "Other/Describe" option
- Designer can modify recommendations
- Questions invite dialogue

## 🎓 Key Insights

### 1. "Not All Figma Dimensions Should Be Matched"

Some dimensions are:
- ✅ **Intent** (font-size 24px = designer wants 24px)
- ⚠️ **Accident** (height 224px = just what fit content)
- 🤷 **Flexible** (designer doesn't care about exact)

**The triage system distinguishes these!**

### 2. "2 Iterations = Sweet Spot"

- 1st iteration: Fix the obvious
- 2nd iteration: Validate what's stuck
- Then ask: Only the hard questions

**Precision > Speed**

### 3. "Designer Questions Need Context"

Bad question:
> "Should this be 224px tall?"

Good question:
> "Figma shows 224px but HTML naturally sizes to 24px. We tried setting fixed height but it breaks content flow. Should we use fixed (224px), flexible (auto), or minimum (224px min)?"

**Context = Better decisions**

### 4. "Human-in-the-Loop is the Key to 85%+"

- Automation gets you to 76%
- Last 9% needs designer understanding
- Complex decisions require human judgment

**This is the breakthrough!**

---
