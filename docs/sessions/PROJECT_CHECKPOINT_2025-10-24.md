# Project Checkpoint: 2025-10-24

**Days 8-9: Evaluation System Overhaul & Test Run Management**

---

## üéØ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Evaluation System Scoring Disconnect

**Problem Identified:**
- Vision LLM gave 95-98% scores when only 50% of pixels matched
- Evaluated "semantic similarity" not pixel-perfect accuracy
- Gave false confidence about code quality

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Rewrote vision evaluation prompt (emphasize pixel-perfect accuracy, harsh scoring)
- ‚úÖ Created weighted scoring system (60% pixel-diff, 40% vision LLM)
- ‚úÖ Pixel-diff as primary ground truth metric
- ‚úÖ Vision LLM provides explanatory feedback (not independent score)

**Impact:**
- System now correctly identifies 79.86% as "NEEDS WORK" (not "EXCELLENT")
- Realistic assessment of code quality
- No more false confidence

---

### 2. Implemented Viewport Matching

**Problem:** Screenshot dimensions didn't match
- Figma artboard: 1440√ó1170 pixels
- Rendered HTML: Random browser size
- Pixel-diff failed due to dimension mismatch

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Created `render_with_viewport_match.py`
- ‚úÖ Reads Figma metadata to get exact artboard dimensions
- ‚úÖ Sets Playwright viewport to match
- ‚úÖ Captures at 2√ó device scale (retina) to match Figma export

**Impact:**
- Apples-to-apples comparison now possible
- Both screenshots are 2880√ó2340 (1440√ó1170 at 2√ó)
- Pixel-diff runs successfully

---

### 3. Trimmed Figma Frame for Focused Testing

**Problem:** Original frame was 2249px tall with 1000px+ empty whitespace
- Wasted pixel comparison on blank space
- Unclear what was "designed" vs. "artboard padding"

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ User trimmed frame to 1440√ó1170 (48% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Fetched new frame metadata (node 157-738)
- ‚úÖ Generated fresh baseline code from trimmed design

**Impact:**
- Focused evaluation on actual designed content
- Clearer design intent
- Faster processing (smaller images)

---

### 4. Built Test Run Management System

**Problem:** Files were being overwritten between tests
- Couldn't confidently compare iterations
- Lost audit trail of improvements
- Uncertain which files were from which test

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Created `scripts/create_test_run.py`
- ‚úÖ Timestamped directories for each test run
- ‚úÖ Structure: code/, screenshots/, diffs/, evaluations/, images/, metadata/
- ‚úÖ Manifest JSON with run metadata

**Test Runs Created:**
1. `2025-10-24_16-54-04_pdp-trimmed-baseline-run1/` - No images (67.94%)
2. `2025-10-24_16-56-20_pdp-trimmed-with-images-run2/` - With images (79.26%)
3. `2025-10-24_17-11-06_pdp-trimmed-improved-run3/` - After improvement (79.86%)

**Impact:**
- Full audit trail of all iterations
- Easy comparison across runs
- No lost work
- Reproducible results

---

### 5. Fixed Image Loading Problem (+18.87 pts!)

**Problem:** Baseline code referenced placeholder images
- Paths: `../images/model-close-up.png` (didn't exist)
- Images showed as gray boxes
- Massive pixel-diff penalty (~60% of viewport was broken)

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Created `scripts/extract_images.py`
- ‚úÖ Extracted 3 product images from Figma (nodes 157:745, 157:746, 157:747)
- ‚úÖ Updated HTML with correct image paths

**Impact:**
- **Pixel-diff: 47.56% ‚Üí 66.43%** (+18.87 pts!)
- **Final score: 67.94% ‚Üí 79.26%** (+11.32 pts!)
- Status improved: POOR ‚Üí NEEDS WORK

---

### 6. Created Baseline Code Generation Agent

**Problem:** No script to generate initial HTML from Figma
- Previous code was manual or unknown process
- Needed fresh generation for new trimmed frame

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Created `scripts/generate_baseline_code.py`
- ‚úÖ Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 with vision
- ‚úÖ Generates HTML/Tailwind from screenshot
- ‚úÖ Fresh context (no contamination from previous attempts)

**Impact:**
- Automated code generation pipeline
- Consistent starting point for iterations
- No breadcrumb nav (correctly excluded from trimmed design)

---

### 7. Ran Full Improvement Iteration

**Process:**
1. Generated baseline code (run1: 67.94%)
2. Fixed images (run2: 79.26%)
3. Ran improvement agent (run3: 79.86%)

**Findings:**
- Vision LLM only provided 1 vague feedback item
- Improvement agent had little to work with
- Pixel-diff remained unchanged (66.43%)
- Vision score went to 100% (falsely "pixel-perfect")

**Key Insight:**
**Vision LLM can't provide dimensional feedback from screenshots alone!**

---

## üìä Current State

### Test Run 3 (Latest)

**Scores:**
- Pixel-Diff: **66.43%** (2,262,597 / 6,739,200 pixels different)
- Vision LLM: **100%** ("pixel-perfect" - wrong!)
- **Final Score: 79.86%** (weighted 60/40)

**Status:** üü† NEEDS WORK - Noticeable differences

**Gap to Target:**
- GOOD (85%): **5.14 points** needed
- EXCELLENT (95%): **15.14 points** needed

**Root Cause:** 33.57% of pixels differ = real layout/styling issues

---

## üîç Critical Discovery: Vision LLM Limitation

### The Pattern Across All Runs

| Run | Pixel-Diff | Vision LLM | Reality |
|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Run 1 | 47.56% | 98.5% | POOR - half the pixels wrong |
| Run 2 | 66.43% | 98.5% | NEEDS WORK - 1/3 pixels wrong |
| Run 3 | 66.43% | 100% | NEEDS WORK - 1/3 pixels wrong |

### Why Vision LLM Fails

**Good at:**
- Semantic similarity ("are product images present?")
- Color matching ("is it pink?")
- Content verification ("does it have the description text?")

**Bad at:**
- Precise measurements ("is it 576px wide?")
- Dimensional accuracy ("are margins exactly 24px?")
- Layout proportions ("are images in 40/30/30% split?")

### The Solution: DOM Measurement Tool

**Instead of:** Asking vision LLM to measure from screenshots

**Do this:** Extract actual DOM measurements and compare to Figma metadata

**Benefits:**
- Objective, not subjective
- Exact measurements, not estimates
- Specific feedback ("400px wide, should be 576px - 31% too narrow")
- Actionable fixes

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. Images Matter A LOT
- Broken images: **-18.87 pts on pixel-diff**
- Always verify image loading in rendered output
- Extract actual Figma images, don't use placeholders

### 2. Viewport Matching is Critical
- Must match Figma artboard dimensions exactly
- Use metadata to set viewport programmatically
- 2√ó device scale factor for retina displays

### 3. Vision LLM Has Fundamental Limits
- Can't measure dimensions accurately from screenshots
- Evaluates semantics, not precision
- Needs structured data (metadata/DOM) not just images

### 4. Weighted Scoring Prevents False Confidence
- Pixel-diff: objective ground truth
- Vision LLM: explanatory context
- Combined (60/40): realistic assessment

### 5. Test Run Management is Essential
- Never overwrite previous results
- Full audit trail enables comparison
- Timestamped directories provide confidence

### 6. Context Clearing is Important
- Fresh code generation prevents contamination
- Breadcrumb nav appeared in old code (not in trimmed design)
- Always regenerate from source of truth

## üöÄ Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priority: DOM Measurement Tool

**Goal:** Get from 79.86% ‚Üí 85%+ (GOOD status)

**Approach:**
1. Extract DOM measurements from rendered HTML
2. Compare to Figma metadata programmatically
3. Generate specific dimensional feedback
4. Feed to improvement agent
5. Re-evaluate

**Expected Impact:**
- 10+ specific feedback items (vs. 1 vague item)
- Actionable fixes ("change width from 400px to 576px")
- Measurable progress each iteration

### Phase 1: Quick Win (2-3 hours)
- Manual mapping for top 5-10 elements
- Validate approach works
- Generate first round of dimensional feedback

### Phase 2: Full Automation (8-12 hours)
- Element matching algorithm
- Handle all elements automatically
- Complete end-to-end pipeline
